# udacity-bikesharing-autogluon
Hi! This is my first project in the Machine Learning Fundamentals Udacity nanodegree. In this project, I built an Autogluon model to predict bike sharing demand using regression. All of my project code is in the Jupyter notebook file inside of the "project" folder. Enjoy!
